            <h2>Fry's Words of Wisdom:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>"Space. It seems to go on forever. But then you get to the end and a gorilla starts throwin' barrels at you."</li>
                <li>"You can't lose hope when it's hopeless. You gotta hope more, then put your fingers in your ears and go, 'blah, blah, blah, blah!'"</li>
                <li>"Wait, I'm having one of those things, you know, a headache with pictures!"</li>
                <li>"I am literally angry with rage!"</li>
                <li>"It's just like the story of the grasshopper and the octopus. All year long, the grasshopper kept burying acorns for winter, while the octopus mooched off his girlfriend and watched TV. But then the winter came, and the grasshopper died, and the octopus ate all his acorns and also he got a racecar. Is any of this getting through to you?"</li>
                <li>"People said I was dumb, but I proved them."</li>
                <li>"In my day, the Internet was only used to download pornography."</li>
                <li>"Wow! A superpowers drug you can rub on your skin? You think it would be something you'd have to freebase."</li>
            </ul>
